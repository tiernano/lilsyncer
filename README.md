lilsyncer
=========

a small tool to sync your Skydrive, Dropbox and iCloud Photo streams together...

The plan for lilsyncer is to allow easy syncing of your Dropbox and SkyDrive photo folders and your iCloud Photo Stream on your machine. 

The plan is to watch the actual folders on your machine, so this runs locally, not in "the cloud". Dropbox, SkyDrive and iCloud will do their magic in the backgroud.
